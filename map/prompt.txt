As the campus settles into silence, a chilling message finds you: your friends are trapped,+locked away in dark corners of HKU. Each building conceals puzzles and secrets, daring you to enter. 
But beware—the halls are watching, and time is not on your side. Can you outwit the shadows,+or will the campus claim more than you bargained for? Step forward… if you dare.
Welcome to the Haking Wong labyrinth. Every turn could be your last.+Are you sure you're alone? Something… or someone… is watching. Do you dare continue?
Ah, you found them… but don't get too comfortable.+Others are still trapped in the dark, waiting for you. If you're fast enough.
Ah, the Main Building… where the past never sleeps. Do you feel the weight of all those who came before you?+They say the walls still whisper their secrets. Listen closely—your friend's fate depends on it.
You unlocked one life, but don't think you're done.+They're still calling for you from deep within the campus's grip...
Chong Yuet Ming awaits. Each step you take echoes through these winding halls…+as if something's following you. Find your friend… before it finds you.
Yes, you're quick… but the clock is ticking. More souls are waiting, and they're growing desperate.+Are you fast enough to save them all?
Welcome to KK Leung… brave enough to step inside? Shadows cling to these walls,+and something sinister waits within. Your friend's time is slipping… tick-tock.
Lucky, aren't you? But this is far from over.+Move swiftly—the others may not have much time left.
The CPD, where knowledge turns to shadows and silence stirs. Did you hear that?+Perhaps it's just the building breathing. Or something else… lurking.
One more soul saved… but can you feel it?+The walls are closing in, and the last of them still need you. Hurry, if you can.
So… you freed them all? Impressive. But don't get too comfortable.+Darkness has a funny way of returning, especially here. Enjoy the light while it lasts.
